# survey
This project is a prompt for a junior web developer to experiment with writing valid HTML with the aid of vanilla CSS. My main goal with this project wasn't perfection. It was to get comfortable moving away from tutorials. The primary goals were image responsiveness, proper use of class and ID tags as well as an eye toward accessibility. The project was a great learning experience. While I exhibited a brief shock at how much I "didn't know" upon starting, at the other end of it, I feel more confident than ever.

## Getting Started

If you'd like to try this prompt as well, I reccomend going to the FreeCodeCamp page here https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-tribute-page 

The Codepen included is where I drew the inspiration for my own tribute page. 

### Prerequisites

You can entirely do this project off codepen.io 

I used VS Code and Github, preferring to gain practice with version control and text editors as well.

## Built With
* HTML
* Vanilla CSS
* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Text Editor
* [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/) - HTML and CSS validation 
* [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - Their documentation is always a great help 


## Versioning

For all purposes intended, this is Mach 1 of my Judit website. I hope to return to it and improve it more and more as I skill up.
